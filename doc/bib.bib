@incollection{Mckeeman1974,
abstract = {A compiler is a program, written in an implementation language, accepting text in a source language and producing text in a target language. Language description languages are used to define all of these languages and themselves as well. The source language is an algorithmic language to be used by programmers. The target language is suitable for execution by some particular computer.},

@article{Smith2005,
abstract = {Interjecting virtualizing software between abstraction layers near the hardware/software interface forms a virtual machine that lets otherwise incompatible subsystems work together. Further, replication by virtualization enables more flexible and efficient use of hardware resources. Given developers' heavy reliance on standards and computer industry consolidation, any major innovation will likely be based on VM technology. In the future, VMs should be viewed as a unified discipline to the same degree that hardware, operating systems, and application software are today. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

@book{EloquentJavaScript,
abstract = {JavaScript is at the heart of almost every modern Web application, whether it's Google Apps, Twitter, or the newest browser-based game. Though it's simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is not a toy—it's a flexible and complex language that can be used to build full-scale applications.Eloquent JavaScript dives into this flourishing language and teaches you to write code that's beautiful and effective. By immersing you in example code and encouraging experimentation right from the start, the author quickly gives you the tools you need to build your own programs. As you follow along with examples like an artificial life simulation and a version of the classic game Sokoban, you'll learn to:* Understand the essential elements of programming: syntax, control, and data* Use object-oriented and functional programming techniques to organize and clarify your programs* Script the browser and make basic Web applications* Work with tools like regular expressions and XMLHttpRequest objectsAnd since programming is an art that's best learned by doing, all example code is available online in an interactive sandbox for you to experiment with. With Eloquent JavaScript as your guide, you can tweak, expand, and modify the author's code, or throw it away and build your own creations from scratch. Before you know it, you'll be fluent in the language of the Web.},
