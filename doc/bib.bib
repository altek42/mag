abstract = {A compiler is a program, written in an implementation language, accepting text in a source language and producing text in a target language. Language description languages are used to define all of these languages and themselves as well. The source language is an algorithmic language to be used by programmers. The target language is suitable for execution by some particular computer.},

@article{Smith2005,
abstract = {Interjecting virtualizing software between abstraction layers near the hardware/software interface forms a virtual machine that lets otherwise incompatible subsystems work together. Further, replication by virtualization enables more flexible and efficient use of hardware resources. Given developers' heavy reliance on standards and computer industry consolidation, any major innovation will likely be based on VM technology. In the future, VMs should be viewed as a unified discipline to the same degree that hardware, operating systems, and application software are today. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},
